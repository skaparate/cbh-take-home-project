# Ticket Breakdown

We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're
working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each
Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including
  some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted
  by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability
for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for
them.**

Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail
for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free
to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".

You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets,
and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your
work.

### Add custom IDs for Agents on the Database (ticket 1)

We need to allow Facilities to save their custom Agent IDs in order for them to generate reports using those IDs.

#### Time

2 days

#### Implementation

1. Create a table for a many-to-many relationship between Facilities and Agents `facility_agents`
2. Add the columns `id_agent` and `id_facility`
3. Add foreign keys for `id_agent` to `agents` table and `id_facility` to `facilities` table
4. Add primary key as `id_agent` and `id_facility` (an agent cannot be duplicated per facility)
5. Add auditing metadata (last_update, last_updated_by, created_at, created_by)

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The table exists.
2. The foreign keys and primary key exists.
3. The auditing metadata exists.

### Add custom IDs to the metadata generated by getShiftsByFacility (ticket 2)

We need to implement the new relationship table to return the custom IDs assigned to them (if any).

#### Time

3 days

#### Implementation

1. Add the model `FacilityAgent` to the ORM for the custom Agent IDs table
2. Integrate the custom IDs to the metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The ORM entities exist.
2. The custom IDs are present on the metadata whenever it's called.

### Use the custom IDs when a report is generated (ticket 3)

To allow Facilities to generate reports using their custom Agent IDs we need to modify the function  `generateReport`.

#### Time

3 days

#### Implementation

1. Add a `FacilityAgent` model to the ORM that allows us to read the custom Agent IDs.
2. Generate the report using the custom IDs instead of the natural ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The ORM model exists.
2. The reports are generated using the custom IDs.
